# EventHorizon-Classic
EventHorizon-Classic ported from 2.4.3 version of EventHorizon

Currently this addon is missing alot of features:
- adding or removing spells
- reordering of spells
- automatic learning of spells from spellbook

Please feel free to open issues if any bugs are encountered as this should be considered an alpha release.
